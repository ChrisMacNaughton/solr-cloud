# Overview
Solr is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more. Solr powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

# Usage

Step by step instructions on using the charm:

    juju deploy solr

and so on. If you're providing a web service or something that the end user needs to go to, tell them here, especially if you're deploying a service that might listen to a non-default port.

You can then browse to http://ip-address to configure the service.


If the charm has any recommendations for running at scale, outline them in examples here. For example if you have a memcached relation that improves performance, mention it here.


This not only helps users but gives people a place to start if they want to help you add features to your charm.
